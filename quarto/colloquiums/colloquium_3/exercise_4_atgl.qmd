```{python}
# Parameters for the inhibition curve
IC50 = 40  # midpoint of inhibition (µM)
hill_slope = 3  # steepness of the curve

# Generate Acyl-CoA concentrations from 0 to 100 µM
acyl_coa = np.linspace(0, 100, 200)

# Calculate % activity using the Hill equation for inhibition
# % Activity = 100 / (1 + ([I]/IC50)^Hill)
percent_activity = 100 / (1 + (acyl_coa / IC50) ** hill_slope)
```

```{python}
# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Acyl_CoA_Concentration": acyl_coa,
    "ATGL_percent_activity": percent_activity
})

print(df)
